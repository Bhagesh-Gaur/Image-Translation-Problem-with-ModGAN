# Image-Translation-Problem-with-ModGAN
Developed an architecture using Conditional GANs with classification module for face generation by introducing auxiliary data, such as attribute vectors or sketches, to guide output. This approach focuses on image resolution and specific facial attributes, aiming to solve the image translation problem for both paired and unpaired image data.
